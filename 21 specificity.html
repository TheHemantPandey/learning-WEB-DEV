        <h2>
            this is one using cascade algotithm. here all of property is in class and purple is last in the css so
            decided by last.
            <br><br>
            here is following ways <br>

            <ol>
                <li>position and order of apperance for same class,id.....</li>
                <li>specificity as follows.. inline css, id selector, class or attribute, element selector and at last
                    the universal selector.
                    <br>
                    and element selector is assign as " data-x="a" ". this previos word is used as class position and in
                    css as .class position
                </li>
                <li>
                    origin. it is decide by the browser
                </li>
                <li>
                    and last is importance
                </li>
                <br>
                one more thing that how the hell this specificity is decided
                 <br><br>
                 for universal selctor it is 0 <br>
                 for element selector it is 1 <br>
                 for class or attrinute selector it is 10 <br>
                 for id selector it is 100 <br>
                 and last for inline css it is 1000 <br> 
                 and if important is after color:red then its specificity will be 10000
